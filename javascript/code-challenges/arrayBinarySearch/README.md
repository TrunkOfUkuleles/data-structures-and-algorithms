# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Use binary tree methodology to build an app that takes an array and a target and returns the index in availible.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
    To use the binbary search tree we are assuming it is an  ordered list and we are not getting some oddball input types. That being said, it is more complicated but far quicker than a linear search. 
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

I approached the problem recursively. I set an initial L/R, and used those as the trackers, but I think I could also have written it a little better by calculating on initial call, and then passed down a spliced array. Maybe if I have time I will write it cleaner. I enbded up taking about an hour. I didn't notice the wiki article, so I spent the first 15 trying to just logic it out  for fun.
