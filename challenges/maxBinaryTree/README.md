# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
add on tree work from last class wityh a new function

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
    extend the class to include a method that will search through and return the largest value held withion that tree.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I went wit hthe standard preorder traversal and held a tracer to return for the largest seen. This is o(n) and is just fine. If I wanted to be better about that, I might have a tracker that ammends the largest when nodes are added

## Solution
