# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
    have two functions attached to the PseudoQueue:
    enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
    dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
starting wit hthe stack class I mocked up what I wanted it to look like on my board. The example in the assignment was more confsing and helpful and seems to imply something very different from what was intended.
