# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

write functions to combine two linked list, alternating

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
    create a function that returns a linked list started with the head of lsit1, then make the next the head of list2, then the next of that from list1, and so on alternating.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I wanted to just get it working wit ha simple flag. a while loop has the current traversing right behind nodes being made. by flagging I switch which list I am drawing from.
